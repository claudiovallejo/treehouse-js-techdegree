# Getting Familiar with HTML and CSS
_Learn the basic structure of a web page, how HTML and CSS are used to change the structure and appearance of web pages, and how HTML and CSS fit into the larger world of web development._

## Welcome to HTML and CSS
HTML and CSS are the two languages used together to structure and style pages.

_HTML_ which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, is simply a set of tags we use to describe to the browser how our webpages are structured. We do this by surrounding the content of our webpages with HTML tags.

_CSS_ or Cascading Style Sheets, is used to tell the browser how we want the content between the tags to look like.

The `<h1>` is part of a set of HTML heading tags that are numbered from 1 - 6. 1 for being the most important text on your page, to the least important being number 6.

CSS _Classes_ `class=""` are one of the ways in which we can tell the CSS how to style an element. The basic idea of CSS is to select the corresponding HTML elements or tags, and between the curly braces add the styling instructions.

## HTML, CSS, and Web Development
Web Development is often split into Front-end Development. Front-end Developers use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build what the client sees, the stuff that runs on the browser. Back-end Developers are responsible for what runs on the server. They use languages like Python, Ruby and Java to work with databases, save, change and retrieve data.
